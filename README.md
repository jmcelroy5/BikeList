BikeList
--------

### Project Description

Bike theft is a rampant problem in urban areas, in part because thieves know they can easily resell a stolen bike. No one wants to contribute to the cycle of theft, but if you find a bike you like on Craigslist or eBay there's no easy way to know if it's stolen. BikeList is an alternative used bike marketplace that introduces more transparency in the bike buying process. BikeList integrates with BikeIndex, an open-source bike registry, to verify that listed bikes are not stolen, and links to the seller's online identity. BikeList provides location-based search and bike-specific search filters as well as a way for buyers to ask questions.
