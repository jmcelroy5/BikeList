BikeList
--------

**Description**

BikeList is an alternative used bike marketplace that introduces more transparency in the bike buying process so you can rest assured that your purchase will not contribute to the cycle of bike theft. BikeList integrates with BikeIndex, an open-source bike registry, to verify that listed bikes are not stolen and uses Facebook OAuth to tie listings to the seller's online identity. A smooth user interface and features such as location-based search, bike-specific search filters, detailed bike specs, and info guides further enhance the bike buyer's experience.
