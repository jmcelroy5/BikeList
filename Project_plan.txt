Potential Names: Velove, BikeList

Require that sellers register their bikes on BikeIndex before creating a listing. App asks user for bike serial number from user then gets bike info via BikeIndex API. User provides a few pieces of listing-specific information (asking price, location, etc.)

To-do list:
	- Display all listings in a list - DONE
	- Display all listings on a map - DONE
	- Search filters 
		- material - DONE
		- price - DONE (but could make into a slider)
		- size 
		- handlebar type - DONE
		- # of gears
		- search by make/model
	- DB optimization stuff: Index listings for search?
	- Airbnbify the design/css, make a navbar - DONE-ish
	- Facebook OAuth for user sign-in - DONE

	- user account management page (delete listings and such)
	- flesh out individual bike listing page (include map, components, seller photos)
	- redo the listing form map (google - mapbox)
	- listing form verification
	- allow user to add favorite bikes!
	- users can ask seller questions about the bike


	- edit listings / post back to BikeIndex?!

Questions:
	- unit testing
	- hiding app keys

Error cases that will need to be handled:
	- bike is stolen
	- bike serial number not found 
	- OR user clicks "no" (we got the wrong bike)
	- If a listing already exists for that bike
	- listing form verification: all fields are filled out and in proper data format
	- if google geocoder returns empty response on listing form

MVP features:

Seller-side:
* Easy sign up - Facebook OAuth
* Link to their Bike Index registration via id or bike serial number - Bike index API
* Listing form: contact info, asking price, location - Leaflet.js
* Listing management: delete/modify listings, add new listing

Buyer-side:
* search for bikes by location 
* see listings on a map and in list form (map and list views side by side)
* filter search by bike attributes
* order by price
* see bike details + the seller’s Facebook profile photo
* Sign in (with Facebook) to see the seller’s contact info
* listing pagination - or load new ones as they scroll down 

Nice-to-have features:

Seller-side:
- Suggest an asking price (will look for a data source for bike resell values)
- Be able to save an (inactive/incomplete) listing for later
- Listing expiration date —> notify seller via email when their listing is about to expire
- Somehow link their listing the bike’s stock photo / specs page on bikebook.io 
- When they delete a listing:
	1) Ask how much they sold it for
	2) Prompt them to change ownership on bikeindex

Buyer-side:
- Detect IP address and automatically center map on user’s location
- Save favorite bike listings

Transactions:
- Users can publicly comment on bike listings and ask the seller questions (use Disqus for this?)
- private messaging between buyers/sellers (this would be awesome but probably a ton of work)
