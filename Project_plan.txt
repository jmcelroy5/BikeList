Potential Names: Velove, BikeList

Require that sellers register their bikes on BikeIndex before creating a listing. Then all I need to ask for is their bike’s serial number (so I can request the bike info via the API) plus a few pieces of listing-specific information (asking price, location, etc.). 

Current task:
	- Make public listing template to replace "listing success" page

Next tasks:
	- Make JSON file and script to populate database (20ish bikes)
	- Make base html template that gets flashed messages
	- Page that displays all listings in a list
	- Display all listings on a map

Error cases that need to be handled:
	- bike is stolen
	- bike serial number not found 
	- OR user clicks "no" (we got the wrong bike)
	- If a listing already exists for that bike
	- listing form verification: all fields are filled out and in proper data format

MVP features:

Seller-side:
* Easy sign up - Facebook OAuth
* Link to their Bike Index registration via id or bike serial number - Bike index API
* Listing form: contact info, asking price, location - Leaflet.js
* Listing management: delete/modify listings, add new listing

Buyer-side:
* search for bikes by location first (zip code?)
* see listings on a map and in list form (map and list views side by side)
* filter search by bike attributes
* order by price
* see bike details + the seller’s Facebook profile photo
* Sign in (with Facebook) to see the seller’s contact info
* listing pagination - or load new ones as they scroll down 

Nice-to-have features:

Seller-side:
- Suggest an asking price (will look for a data source for bike resell values)
- Be able to save an (inactive/incomplete) listing for later
- Listing expiration date —> notify seller via email when their listing is about to expire
- Somehow link their listing the bike’s stock photo / specs page on bikebook.io 
- When they delete a listing:
	1) Ask how much they sold it for
	2) Prompt them to change ownership on bikeindex

Buyer-side:
- Detect IP address and automatically center map on user’s location
- Save favorite bike listings

Transactions:
- Users can publicly comment on bike listings and ask the seller questions (use Disqus for this?)
- private messaging between buyers/sellers (this would be awesome but probably a ton of work)
