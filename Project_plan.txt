Potential Names: Velove, BikeList

Require that sellers register their bikes on BikeIndex before creating a listing. Then all I need to ask for is their bike’s serial number (so I can request the bike info via the API) plus a few pieces of listing-specific information (asking price, location, etc.). 

Today:
	- Build out Bike table in database
	- Make JSON file to populate database (maybe 10ish bikes)

MVP:

Seller-side:
* Easy sign up - Facebook OAuth
* Link to their Bike Index registration via id or bike serial number - Bike index API
* Listing form: contact info, asking price, location - Leaflet.js
* Listing management: delete/modify listings, add new listing

Buyer-side:
* search for bikes by location first (zip code?)
* see listings on a map and in list form (map and list views side by side)
* filter search by bike attributes
* see bike details + the seller’s Facebook profile photo
* Sign in (with Facebook) to see the seller’s contact info
* listing pagination (order by most recent) - or ajax request to load new ones as they scroll down (ala twitter feed)

Nice-to-haves:

Seller-side:
- Suggest an asking price (will look for a data source for bike resell values)
- Be able to save an (inactive/incomplete) listing for later
- Listing expiration date —> notify seller via email when their listing is about to expire
- Somehow link their listing the bike’s stock photo / specs page on bikebook.io (the bike catalogue, which I found to be lacking - only goes back a few years for most manufacturers, so it’s useless for older bikes)
- When they delete a listing:
	1) Ask how much they sold it for
	2) Prompt them to change ownership on bikeindex

Buyer-side:
- detect IP address and automatically center map on user’s location
- Save favorite bike listings

Transactions:
- Users can publicly comment on bike listings and ask the seller questions (use Disqus for this!?)
- private messaging between buyers/sellers (this would be awesome but probably a ton of work)
